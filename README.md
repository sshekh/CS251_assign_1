This repository is a part of my assignment under the course CS251. It will contain some basic files, then some branches will have to be made.
Those branches will get their own edits and files. Now some of them will be merged with the master branch along with confilcts. The conflicts
will then have to be resolved. Also while pushing the code to the origin there need to be different conflicts on the same merged code, and then 
individual contributions will have to be taken into account.
